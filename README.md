This project shows how to use Flyway in an application so we can release database changes automatically.

It contains examples of configuration files, SQL files and a script that generates files based on the application version and a JIRA ticket number. 

# To do #

- Prepare a blog post about it explaining how it works and how to use it
- Modify the file generator so it separates DDL and DML
- Create a version for Linux of the file generator as the current one is for Windows (Powershell)
